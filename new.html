 	<p style="color:black;"><small>Financial institutions need to continually weigh the risks of their transactions, 
 	and they determine their risk level through credit scoring. Leading up to the 2008-09 financial 
 	crisis, almost all large banks used credit scoring models based on statistical theories; 
 	that crisis, largely brought about by underestimating risk, proved the need for better accuracy 
 	in their scoring. The combination of increased requirements and the development of advanced new 
 	technologies has given rise to a new era: credit scoring using machine learning.</small></p>
